# Tramontana Android app

## What is Tramontana

Usually we interact with one digital device at a time in the same space, this being a phone, a smart
TV or a computer.

This changes when we look at other interactive systems like connected devices or interactive spaces.

This is what Tramontana allows to do: prototyping an interactive system with different interaction
touchpoints. Tramontana is designed for creating rich interactive experiences with _few lines of
code_.

## What is this repo

This Git repository is for the Tramontana Android app. It allows your Android device to be used from
a Processing sketch running on your machine.

The Android app is open-source. From here you can browse the code and modify it to your preferences.

If you only need to set up a Tramontana environment with your Android phone, then you can simply
[install the Android app from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pierdr.pierluigidallarosa.myactivity)
.

## Building it

You only need to build the Android app yourself if you want to change it in any way, e.g. fixing
bugs or make improvements.

The app can be built with Android Studio. Once the project is opened, it should automatically
download all the dependencies. Upon clicking Run, it will compile and install on the Android device
of your choice or the emulator.

## How to contribute

If you want to contribute to Tramontana, welcome! Feel free to create bug reports or open pull requests.

After each accepted pull request the main contributors will compile and sign the app, and send it
for approval to the Play Store.
